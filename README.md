# Hello! 👋 I'm Valerio Armenante

I'm a Computer Science Engineer, specializing in data engineering, machine learning, and software development. I graduated at the Politecnico of Milan with a Master Degree in Computer Science and Engineering, where I built a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and programming. 

## 👨‍💻 About Me
- 🔍 Currently exploring advanced data science techniques and their applications in real-world scenarios.
- 💻 Experienced in data engineering and machine learning, with proficiency in Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras and other tools in the data science ecosystem.
- 🏃‍♂️ Passionate about sports and always eager to combine my technical skills with my enthusiasm for athletics.
- 📂 Worked on various projects within the informatics field, gaining hands-on experience in software engineering and project management.
  
## 📂 Past Projects
### [Project 1: Amazon Discount Offer Telegram Bot](https://github.com/valearm/bot_telegram)
**Description**: This project contains a Telegram bot written in Python that interacts with Amazon using the PA-API 5 SDK. The bot allows users to query Amazon's product catalog via Telegram, offering an easy interface for retrieving product details.

### [Project 2: Italian Lottery Prediction](https://github.com/valearm/LSTM-Project)
**Description**:  This project involves **web scraping** historical data from an Italian lottery game to build a dataset of winning numbers and their draw dates. Using this data, an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network** is applied to identify potential patterns and trends for predicting future draws.

## 📂 Current Projects
### Project 3: AiDocGen WIP
**Description**: I am currently working on a VSCode plugin which automatically add comments on your VSCode file following **Docstring Format** in order to speed up your project development of any kind.

### Project 4: Auto-Trading Software 
**Description**: This project is a fully **automated trading system** developed in Python using the **MetaTrader5** API. The system connects to a MetaTrader5 account to execute real-time trades based on a proprietary algorithm designed to identify optimal entry and exit points in the market. The algorithm incorporates technical indicators, price patterns, and market trends to make informed trading decisions.

## Competitions on Kaggle 🏆

### [Movielens 🎬]
- **Description**: Develop a content-based recommender system for movies using the Movielens dataset.
- **Approach**: The approach used to build the recommender system is based on **Content-Based Filtering**, which relies on similarities between items (films) calculated from their metadata (title + genres). Additionally, I extended the model using **BERT transformers** for improved accuracy. 🤖
  
### [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques 🏠]
- **Description**: This playground competition involves predicting the final price of homes in Ames, Iowa, based on 79 explanatory variables, including various aspects of the homes.
- **Objective**: Predict the sales price for each house. The competition is evaluated based on **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** between the predicted and actual sales prices (log-transformed).
- **Approach**: I used a **Ridge Regression** model for this task. Special attention was given to managing missing values and properly encoding categorical columns. 🧑‍💻
- **Results**: Best score: **0.17086 RMSE** 🥇

### [Data Science London + Scikit-learn 📊]
- **Description**: This is a binary classification task. The goal is to predict labels (1 or 0) based on a training set of 1000 samples and a test set of 9000 samples.
- **Approach**: I experimented with multiple models, and the best results came from using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier. **XGBoost** also yielded similar results. ⚙️
- **Results**: Accuracy: **0.87** ✅

## 💡 Challenges

Building skills through challenges on platforms like LeetCode and Kaggle has been a valuable part of my learning journey. Here’s a look at some key areas I’ve focused on:

- **Algorithmic Challenges on LeetCode**: I regularly solve problems on LeetCode to strengthen my data structures and algorithms skills, with a focus on preparing for technical interviews. Key areas include:
  - **Dynamic Programming**: Tackling complex problems like the Longest Palindromic Substring has deepened my understanding of optimization techniques.
  - **Bit Manipulation**: Practicing bitwise operations has improved my problem-solving speed and adaptability.
  - **Advanced Data Structures**: Working with structures like heaps, tries, and graphs has helped me approach a wider variety of coding problems with confidence.

- **Data Science Competitions on Kaggle**: I engage in Kaggle competitions to refine my data science and machine learning expertise. These challenges provide hands-on experience with:
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Handling large, unstructured datasets to clean, transform, and make data ready for modeling.
  - **Feature Engineering**: Developing meaningful features to improve model accuracy, especially in complex domains like natural language processing and computer vision.
  - **Model Tuning**: Optimizing algorithms through hyperparameter tuning and ensembling to improve performance in competitive settings.

These challenges have not only improved my technical skills but also fostered a strategic approach to problem-solving and adaptability in dynamic environments.
