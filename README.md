## 📂 Past Projects
### [Project 1: Amanzon Offer Telegram Bot](https://github.com/valearm/bot_telegram)
**Description**: This project contains a Telegram bot written in Python that interacts with Amazon using the PA-API 5 SDK. The bot allows users to query Amazon's product catalog via Telegram, offering an easy interface for retrieving product details.

### [Project 2: Italian Lottery Prediction]([https://github.com/yourusername/project2](https://github.com/valearm/LSTM-Project))
**Description**:  This project involves **web scraping** historical data from an Italian lottery game to build a dataset of winning numbers and their draw dates. Using this data, an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network** is applied to identify potential patterns and trends for predicting future draws.

## 📂 Current Projects
### [Project 3: AiDocGen] (Private at the moment)
**Description**: I am currently working on a VSCode plugin which automatically add comments on your VSCode file following **Docstring Format** in order to speed up your project development of any kind.

### [Project 4: Auto-Trading Software] (Private)
**Description**: This project is a fully **automated trading system** developed in Python using the **MetaTrader5** API. The system connects to a MetaTrader5 account to execute real-time trades based on a proprietary algorithm designed to identify optimal entry and exit points in the market. The algorithm incorporates technical indicators, price patterns, and market trends to make informed trading decisions.
